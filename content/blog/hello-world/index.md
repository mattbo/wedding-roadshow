(Matt here…) I’ve probably started a blog a half-dozen times over the years. Back in the day (mid-00’s?) it was en vogue and all the cool kids had one. To be honest, I’ve always preferred listening to talking.

But, here we are. And I somehow feel compelled to fill all this white space with tales of #vanlife (it’s not a movement; just ask Charla), broken traditions, and adventures in not-really-wedding wedding planning.

To be honest, Charla does all the planning. I try to quietly float through the world, taking it as it comes. Unless it’s electronic or software related, in that case I have strong opinions. As a result, identifying, purchasing, upgrading, and preparing the van has been my project.

The rest of this post is full of details that no one should be interested in. You’ve been warned.

We got a 2006 Mercedes Sprinter. It’s a 5 cylinder diesel (did you know that engines can come with odd-numbered cylinders? I did not!). It has 217,000 miles, but the internet assures me that this particular engine can go for a million miles with proper maintenance. Will we maintain it properly??? Time will tell.

The guys we bought it from are Sprinter mechanics. They bought this one at a FedEx fleet sale and converted the interior (insulation, flooring, solar panels, batteries, inverter, sink, fridge, fresh and grey water tanks, cabinets, stove, windows, backup camera, benches and a table that convert to a bed.

That was all done when we found it, but they offered to make any changes we wanted for a very reasonable fee. So… upgraded the electrical, added an extra table, added a spiffy new radio, and a custom roof rack.

I had no idea how daunting it is to specify a roof rack! Talk about paralyzed by choices!! I saw one at a TinyHomes show (yes, I paid money to look at other people’s vans…). It’s basically a cage that locks a bunch of 10 gallon rubbermaid totes inside. Seemed like a much better plan than (very expensive) roof rack boxes.

As I sit here I’ve described it to the mechanic and I have no idea whether or not I’m going to get what I expect.

Ok, now I’m boring even myself. Maybe I’ll come back later and write about the shenanigans that accompany picking a car stereo. You hope not.
