      <p> Our biggest wish on this wedding-road-trip-adventure is to spend time
          with friends and family.  So the ideal gift would be the gift of your
          time.  Sit with us on the proch or in the park. Show us your favorite
          local spots.  Or just let us park in your driveway and be in your hair          for a few days!  </p>

      <p> That said, for friends and family who have expressed an interest,
           we have registered with a site called honeyfund.</p>
