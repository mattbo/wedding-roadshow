excerpt: Matt was scarred as a child
---

Matt was scarred as a youth and is no longer interested in huge parties where you don’t get to spend time with people.

Charla just wants to make everyone she’s ever known be very uncomfortable share their feelings. Or read a poem.

So we’re turning our wedding on its head. Instead of having everyone we love pack their bags and schlep out to California, we’re gonna pack our bags (you know Charla will take any excuse to pack her bags…). You get to spend more quality time with us. We get to not feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of people. And no one has to eat wedding chicken (not that the chicken at your wedding was bad. Everyone loved it. Really!).

The Plan
The ceremony and the documents will happen in July, and in August we hit the road. The western US will happen in late summer / autumn 2020. Then a few months snowbirding in the South and we’ll make our way up the East Coast in Spring 2021. Early summer we’ll cross into Canada and make our way back to the Midwest and end the tour in Wisconsin in July 2021!

Along the way we’re going to stop and see everyone. And see the last of the 50 states that are still on the to-do list. And probably take a couple of sabbaticals to Hanoi and Bogota.

We know, it’s a tough life. Just remember, we’re doing it for you.
