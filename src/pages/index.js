      <h3>AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT…</h3>
      <p> We’re sure that it comes as a surprise to no one, but we’re upending
        ritual and tradition and doing our own thing. </p>

      <p>Keep reading about the idea. Then take a look
        at&nbsp;<Link to="map">the map</Link>. Don’t forget to add some
        tracks to our&nbsp;<Link to="playlist">playlist</Link>.  And photos to
        the <Link to="photos">photo albums</Link>.</p>

      <p>Global pandemics notwithstanding, we hope to see each and every one of
        you around your stomping grounds real soon!</p>

      <h3>The idea: no big to-do, just time with you</h3>
      <p>Matt was scarred as a child and is no longer interested in huge parties
        where you don’t get to spend time with people.  </p>

      <p>Charla just always wants to go visit everyone she's ever known for long
        enough to ask eighty questions and tell far too long a story. </p>

      <p>So we’re turning our wedding on its head: instead of having everyone
        we love pack their bags and schlep out to California for a whirlwind
        weekend, we’re gonna pack <em>our</em> bags and roll your way.  We'll be
        coming through for relaxed, informal visits - a chance for us to meet
        more of each other's people, to hang out, and to catch up.  You get to
        spend more quality time with us. We get to not feel overwhelmed
        by the sheer number of people. And no one has to deal with the TSA.</p>

      <h5>The extra cute part</h5>
      <p>Awkwardly soon into dating we realized that we both had this same
        idea.  And now it's actually happening.</p>

      <h3>The plan</h3>
      <p>The saying of the official words and the signing of documents <span
          className='strikethrough'>will happen in July </span> happened on July
          7, 2021 with our immediate family, followed by some celebrating in
          SoCal. On August 11, 2021 we hit the road. The western US will happen
          in late summer / autumn <span className="strikethrough"> 2020 </span>
          2021. After a few months snowbirding in the South we’ll make our way
          up the East Coast in Spring <span
          className="strikethrough">2021</span> 2022. Early summer we’ll cross
          into Canada and make our way back to the Midwest and end the tour in
          Wisconsin in Summer <span className="strikethrough">2021</span> 2022!
      </p>

      <p>Along the way we want to stop and see you, hear all about how you are,
        and revel in the fact that we are not on Zoom. No formal affairs of
        functions, just the opportunity to see you.  In person.  Finally.
        While we're at it one of us two might beat the other to their 50th
        state.  And if we are extra, extra lucky, we'll take a couple of
        sabbaticals to Hanoi and Bogota. </p>

      <p>We know, it’s a tough life. Just remember, we’re doing it for you. </p>
